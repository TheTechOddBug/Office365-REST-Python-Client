"""Teams — creating, listing, updating, archiving, and deleting teams.

Tests cover:
  - Creating a team with a unique name
  - Listing all teams in the org
  - Listing joined teams for the current user
  - Getting a team by ID with property assertions
  - Updating team settings (funSettings)
  - Archiving and unarchiving a team
  - Cloning a team (clone_and_wait)
  - Deleting a team
  - Team property assertions (messagingSettings, funSettings, guestSettings, isArchived)
